WARNING: 
If the simulation freezes, close the window and reopen it using the github page link: https://pcwu1.github.io/PHYS408A_Project/
The page will freeze when you click away or unfocus the window.

The webGL code will run on the local GPU, so it might be laggy or slow on some computers.

This simulation was built upon a template called "ch05_01_simple-animation.html" in the book "Real-Time 3D Graphics with WebGL 2nd Edition" by Farhad Ghayour and Diego Cantor
